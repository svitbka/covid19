# COVID19 Dashboard

## Introdution 
Hello everybody! This is a COVID 19 dashboard that I started as a pet-project and I'm currently working on it alone.
At the moment, you can view the statistics of the Ministry of Health, which is updated automatically every day. As an addition, statistics(infections and deaths) were implemented, which predicts how the virus SHOULD spread according to mathematical predictions.

P.S. This forecast does not claim to be absolutely reliable, since there are many factors that affect the accuracy of the model. The model is accurate exactly as accurate as the estimates of the spread of the disease are. The forecast is purely illustrative in nature, on the basis of which it is IMPOSSIBLE to draw an unambiguous conclusion about the real spread of the virus in the country.
